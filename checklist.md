# Stretch Goals
Acheive these through utilizing branching

  * Add Bootstrap to the front end and style away
    - Buttons -- make the buttons and completion buttons green and the delete red.
    - Inputs -- make your text inputs styled in the bootstrap way
    - Responsive -- make the app responsive to different screen sizes
2. feature-confirm-delete
  *In Whatever fashion you would like, create an 'are you sure: yes/no' option when deleting a task.
3. feature-ordering-task-query
  *Research Query Params to have the request reverse the order of the returned todos.
4. feature-time-completed
  * Add the ability to record when a task was completed. Show the completed date on the frontend in a pretty format.
